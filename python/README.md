The python scripts used for analysing and plotting data are stored here.

	1. analysis.py gathers the displacement values for MD runs.
	2. plots_analysis.py plots the data from analysis.py.
	3. plots_over_time.py plots the system states from MD runs. 
	4. setup.py creates needed directories and can delete previous run data.
	5. control.py is used to invoke other scripts.
